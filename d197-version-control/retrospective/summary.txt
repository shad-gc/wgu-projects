To resolve the merge conflict in part E1, I opened the ReadMe file using nano while the merge was in process. When the file was opened, I cleared out the extra text above, below, and in the middle of the Student ID text and Version
number text. Because the two lines of text were on separate lines, the merge conflict was resolved.

I made three edits to HTML files in part C.

The first of the three edits was in the about.html file where I edited the Title of the page to "WGU - About Us" and edited the h1 header to say "About the Team".
The second of the three edits was changing the title in the services.html file. I changed the title from "WGU - Test" to "WGU - What We Do".
The last of the three edits took place within the contact.html file. In this file, I added my WGU email as a means of contact for the site visiter. I added a mailto: link for my email.
